Authentication
==============

The Oracle Graph server (PGX) uses an Oracle Database as identity manager. Both username and password based as well as Kerberos based authentication is supported.

You can connect to a remote graph server (PGX) instance in your Python program. You must first authenticate with the remote server before you can create a session as illustrated in the following example::

   import pypgx as pgx
   import pypgx.pg.rdbms.graph_server as graph_server

   base_url = "https://localhost:7007"
   username = "scott"
   password = "tiger"

   instance = graph_server.get_instance(base_url, username, password)
   session = instance.create_session("python_pgx_client")
   print(session)

if your token expires, you can log in again without losing any of your session data by reauthenticating as illustrated in the following example::

   graph_server.reauthenticate(instance, "<user>", "<password>") # log in again

Refer to the section below, for the complete API reference on user authentication.
