Connecting using PGQL-on-RDBMS
==============================

To connect using DB credentials directly the following convenience method can be used, otherwise a JDBC connection object needs to be provided.

.. automethod:: opg4py.pgql.get_connection

Connecting to PGQL-on-RDBMS involves getting a connection object, that allows further operations such as creating a statement or retrieving metadata on the underlying JDBC connection.

.. autoclass:: opg4py.pgql.PgqlConnection
